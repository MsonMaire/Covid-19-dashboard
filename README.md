# Covid-19-dashboard

## Project Overview
This project focuses on creating an interactive dashboard to visualize key metrics such as COVID-19 cases, recovery rates, and vaccination progress globally. The dashboard provides insights into the impact of the pandemic, enabling users to track trends and make informed decisions based on the data.

## Dataset
The dataset used is `covid_19_clean_complete.csv`, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/corona-virus-report), which includes global data on COVID-19 cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations.

## Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** (for data cleaning and aggregation)
- **Python** (for data manipulation and visualization)
- **Plotly** (for creating interactive visualizations and dashboards)
- **Google Colab** (for running the project in a cloud environment)

## Project Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: Processed and cleaned the data using SQL queries.
2. **Data Visualization**: Used Python with Plotly to create interactive charts, including line and bar charts.
3. **Dashboard Creation**: Developed an interactive dashboard using Dash to track COVID-19 metrics and trends.

## Key Insights
- Visualized the global distribution of COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and deaths.
- Created an interactive, real-time dashboard displaying trends in daily cases and vaccination rates.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `COVID19_Data_Dashboard.ipynb` file in Google Colab.
3. Run the notebook to clean the data, generate visualizations, and launch the dashboard.
